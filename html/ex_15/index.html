        <h1>Winnipes councillor calls for gun ban</h1>
        <p>Winnipeg City Council’s protection chair is calling for “swift” action to ban handguns across Canada, in the wake of a deadly weekend shooting.

            Coun. Sherri Rollins (Fort Rouge–East Fort Garry) called on Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to apply the change nation-wide.
            
            “Handguns should not be in the city, unless they’re on the hip of a police officer,” said Rollins.
            
            While the prime minister has planned on allowing municipalities to individually decide if a ban is needed, Rollins said she’d like to see the weapons prohibited in all cities and towns instead.
            
            The councillor said she believes a ban would help make guns less available. Winnipeg is coping with a recent string of violent crime, including a fatal early Sunday shooting at the Windsor Hotel. Police say gunfire killed one man and injured two others in that Garry Street incident.</p>

        <h1>Mayor would alter Battle of Batoche monument</h1>
        <p>City council’s newly proposed policy on naming and renaming places and historical markers is one vote away from becoming a reality.

            On Tuesday, council’s executive policy committee voted in favour of a plan to handle those naming decisions, including in cases where a current name’s impact on Indigenous people raises concerns. If council approves, the process would see renaming requests assessed by a committee of community members, who would then make recommendations to city council.
            
            Mayor Brian Bowman said there are “many” specific historical markers whose names he’s personally concerned with, including the text on the Volunteer Monument beside the Centennial Concert Hall.
            
            First created in 1886, the towering monument commemorates those killed in the North West Rebellion, the Battle of Fish Creek and the Battle of Batoche.
            
            “That commemorates the loss of life in the Battle of Batoche … for everybody but the Metis,” said Bowman.
